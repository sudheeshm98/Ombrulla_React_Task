   - Organize the project structure logically.
   - Use meaningful file and folder names.
   - Separate concerns by creating reusable components.

8. Performance Optimization
   - Optimize the website for performance.
   - Minimize the use of unnecessary dependencies.

13. Testing
   - Write unit tests for critical components using a testing library like Jest. (if possible)
